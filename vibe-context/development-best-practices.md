# Development Best Practices

**IF YOU ARE AN AI ASSISTANT YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES**

1. Plan out complex changes before implementing anything. This plan should incldue searching and researching documentation in this code base for relevant guidance. Save the plan to a temporary markdown file in the repository and get human approval before beginning.
2. This repository comes equipped with a `Makefile`. Running `make all` will run linting and unit tests. In order for code to be successfully pushed through the built-in CI/CD pipeline, it will have to pass these tests. So, be sure to run linting, formatting, etc periodically to make sure the code is properly formatted and is free of linting errors.

Remember: Always prioritize code quality, security, and maintainability in your development practices.
