# Code Conventions

**IF YOU ARE AN AI ASSISTANT YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES**

1. Always add a docstring to every function you write explaining the purpose of the function, the names and types of input variables, and output responses.
2. Always use explicit strong types where possible in method signatures and return types.
3. Comment any non-obvious code thoroughly. Assume the reader of the code has moderate to low understanding of the coding language and/or the libraries used.
4. Always avoid implementing fallback methods to default values just to make sure the code runs properly. It is better for the code to fail loudly than allow unexpected issues to pass through silently.
5. Prefer to use named parameters over positional parameters when making method calls.

**ALWAYS FOLLOW THESE RULES WHEN YOU WORK IN THIS PROJECT**
